# Final Project

# This project displays a game of jumping over obstacles and collecting items in a web application.

# Instructions:
# Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move:
#    - Press the "UP" arrow key to jump 
#    - Press the "LEFT" arrow key to move left 
#    - Press the "RIGHT" arrow key to move right 
#    - Press the "DOWN" arrow key to move down 
# Collect the orange "balls of warmth" for extra points.
# When you hit a "snow pillar"/ block of white, the game will end.
# Or if you chose to end at a certain point, the game will end then as well.
